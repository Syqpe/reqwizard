## Reqwizard

![Reqwizard Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

The Reqwizard project was invented by me literally in a few minutes, I tried to fit all my experience in development into this project, I hope it worked out.

Reqwizard is a platform designed to provide efficient and secure processing of user feedback. There are two key roles represented in this project: users and managers.

Users have the opportunity to create private or public Requests in which they can describe their requests and needs. Applications can be of various types, which allows the user to choose the most appropriate way of presenting information.

At the same time, managers on the Reqwizard platform are processing Applications and providing responses to them. This functionality creates a unique interaction between users and specialists, ensuring a high degree of accountability and accuracy in servicing requests.

Particular attention is paid to data confidentiality. Our mechanisms provide reliable protection of Applications and responses from unauthorized access. This ensures that information remains private and accessible only to those who have the right to see it.

Additionally, the notification system in Reqwizard accompanies you at every stage of processing. As soon as a response from the manager appears, you will instantly receive a notification, which provides instant information and facilitates further interaction.

The Reqwizard project was created using advanced technologies and taking care of your comfort and safety. We also pay special attention to authentication and confirmation of roles, so that each participant can enjoy all the benefits of the platform only after successfully completing the approval process.

Welcome to the world of Reqwizard - a place where feedback becomes reliable, convenient and confidential!
